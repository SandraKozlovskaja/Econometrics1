## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


Reading a CSV file

Unfortunately, it is rare to have just a few data points that you do not mind 
typing in at the prompt. It is much more common to have a lot of data points with 
complicated relationships. Here we will examine how to read a data set from a file 
using the read.csv function.

We assume that the data file is in the format called “comma separated values” (csv).
That is, each line contains a row of values which can be numbers or letters, and 
each value is separated by a comma. We also assume that the very first row contains
a list of labels. The idea is that the labels in the top row are used to refer to
the different columns of values.

First we read a very short, somewhat silly, data file. For example, the data file 
is called simple.csv and has three columns of data and six rows. The three columns are
labeled “trial,” “mass,” and “velocity.” We can pretend that each row comes from 
an observation during one of two trials labeled “A” and “B.”

The command to read the data file is read.csv. We have to give the command at 
least one arguments, but we will give three different arguments to indicate how 
the command can be used in different situations. The first argument is the name 
of file. The second argument indicates whether or not the first row is a set of 
labels. The third argument indicates that there is a comma between each number 
of each line. 

If R is not finding the file you are trying to read then it may be looking in 
the wrong folder/directory. If you are using the graphical interface you can
change the working directory from the file menu. If you are not sure what files 
are in the current working directory you can use the dir() command to list the 
files and the getwd() command to determine the current working directory.

There are many different ways to keep track of data in R. When you use the 
read.csv command R uses a specific kind of variable called a “data frame.” 
All of the data are stored within the data frame as separate columns. If 
you are not sure what kind of variable you have then you can use the 
attributes command. This will list all of the things that R uses to 
describe the variable.
